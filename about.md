Coderox was founded in Vallentuna, Sweden in August 2011 by Johan Lindfors after several of years working at [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.se/) and also a short period with [Infozone](http://www.infozone.se/). After having been one of the most familiar faces in the Swedish developer community, evangelizing the Microsoft technologies and products, Johan decided it was time to build something new and exciting.

This website is hosted on [Github Pages](https://github.com/pages) and built with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), using a customized version of the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.
