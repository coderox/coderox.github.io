Having had some very interesting and fun years since Coderox was started I simply haven't had the time to blog or spend time on side projects. Also I haven't felt very comfortable with the solutions I've used for blogging. I've tried Orchard, Umbraco and even Ghost but neither have felt natural to me. So now it's time to try and evaluate a very simple and neat solution with running Jekyll on GitHub pages. It's a completely free solution (well at least as long you accept that the repo you use for publishing is public) and so far seems very nice.

I'm now using Visual Studio Code to write my blog posts and then use git to submit them for publish. I still have to get accustomed to the markup language and how to handle images and such but for now it seems very nice and something I'd probably get used to.

Below is some more information about Jekyll that comes with the initial posts:

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
